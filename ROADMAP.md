# Roadmap

In my opinion, the app has a very exciting development trajectory.
The app can utilize the power of backend as a service solutions such as Firebase and become a full-fledged Social Media.

The images/videos can be uploaded and liked by anyone. The app will also have a trending section which will display all the trending media (I have actually implemented this in my MeowTube app which uses Hot-Ranking Algorithm similar to Reddit which works using Cloud Functions).

The users will be able to follow other users and can share posts through dynamic deep links. They will also be able to search and chat with other users. Video player can use cache to save data.

A proper Analytics and Crashlytics system can be integrated so that better feedback can be collected.

The app has a lot of room for growth and I am sure that given time, it might be developed into a full-fledged Social Media app.
